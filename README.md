Product CRUD API

A simple RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (Mongoose) that implements full CRUD functionality. This project was created as a backend learning exercise focusing on routing, database integration, and basic error handling.

🚀 Features

Create new products

Read all products

Read product by ID

Update product

Delete product

Basic error handling (404 & 500 responses)

🧠 API Concept

This API represents a Product Catalog / Entertainment Media Product, where each product stores metadata such as title, genre, and rating. It can be used as a base for a watchlist or catalog system.

Example Fields

title – Name of the product/media

type – Media type (e.g., K-Drama, Movie)

genre – Category

author – Creator or director

year – Release year (Number)

rating – User rating (Number)

isFavorite – Boolean flag

📡 API Endpoints

Base route depends on how the router is mounted (e.g., /products).

🔹 Get All Products

GET /products

Returns all products from the database.

🔹 Get Product by ID

GET /products/:id

Returns a single product by MongoDB ObjectId.

Responses:

200 → Product found

404 → Data not found

500 → Server error

🔹 Create Product

POST /products

Create a new product.

Required fields:

title

type

genre

author

year (Number)

rating (Number)

🔹 Update Product

PUT /products/:id

Update an existing product by ID.

Returns the updated document using { new: true } option.

🔹 Delete Product

DELETE /products/:id

Deletes a product by ID.

Response:

{
  "message": "Data deleted successfully"
}
⚠️ Error Handling

This API includes basic error handling:

404 Not Found → Returned when data does not exist

500 Internal Server Error → Returned for unexpected errors

Some endpoints use async/await with try-catch, while others use promise .then().catch() handling.


📌 Learning Goals

This project was built to practice:

REST API fundamentals

MongoDB CRUD operations

Mongoose modeling

Async vs Promise handling

Basic backend folder structure

Error handling in Express
